properties:
  acceleration:
    description: The acceleration of the projectile in metres per second per second.
      If NULL, the projectile will not accelerate and retain its initial speed.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: float
  arm_distance:
    description: Minimum travel distance before the projectile is armed and can detonate.
      Used for Flak and Archer explosions.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: int32
  detonate_distance:
    description: Proximity required for Flak detonation.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: float
  detonate_on_contact:
    description: Whether the projectile will detonate on contact with a surface or
      player.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: boolean
  drag:
    type: string
    x-cast-to: float
  gravity:
    description: Gravity applied to the projectile in metres per second per second.
      Togther with the current `speed`, this can be used to calculate bullet drop
      over time.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: float
  lifespan:
    description: Lifespan of the projectile in seconds. Together with `speed`, `acceleration`,
      and `speed_max`, this can be used to calculate the maximum range of a given
      projectile.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: float
  lockon_acceleration:
    description: Acceleration of the projectile while locked onto a target.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: float
  lockon_lifespan:
    description: Duration of the lock-on effect in seconds. After this time, the lock
      will be lost.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: float
  lockon_lose_angle:
    description: Field of view of the projectile when tracking a target. If the target
      escapes this cone, the lock is lost.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: float
  lockon_proximity_distance:
    description: Distance at which the projectile will proximity-lock onto a target
      while in flight. Note that this value designates the diameter of the sphere
      of influence, not the radius.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: float
  lockon_seek_in_flight:
    description: Whether a dumb-fired projectile will attempt to lock onto targets
      in flight. Used by the Coyote and Hyena missile launchers.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: boolean
  projectile_flight_type_id:
    description: The `ps2/projectile_flight_type` of the projectile.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: int32
    x-reference-to: projectile_flight_type.projectile_flight_type_id
  projectile_id:
    description: Unique ID of the projectile.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: int32
  projectile_radius:
    description: The radius of the projectile in metres. Relevant to hitbox collisions.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: float
  speed:
    description: The initial speed of the projectile upon firing in meters per second.
      Note that this may be different from the muzzle velocity displayed for a given
      weapon.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: int32
  speed_max:
    description: Upper bound of the speed of the projectile in meters per second.
      On projectiles with a non-NULL `acceleration`, this is the top speed the projectile
      will reach.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: int32
  sticks_to_players:
    description: Whether the projectile will stick to infantry on contact. Note that
      in addition to Sticky Grenades, this will also be true for projectiles that
      only stick to MAXes, such as Nano-Repair or Anti-Vehicle Grenades.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: boolean
  sticky:
    description: Whether the projectile will stick to surfaces. This includes Sticky
      Grenades and bricks of C-4 explosives.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: boolean
  tether_distance: {}
  turn_rate:
    description: Turn rate of the projectile in degrees per second. Used to limit
      the ability of lock-on projectiles to track their target.
    type: string
    x-cast-to: float
type: object
