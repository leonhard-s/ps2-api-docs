    "description": "## Introduction\n\nThe Daybreak Game Company Census API provides access to game and character data for the MMOFPS\n[PlanetSide 2](https://www.planetside2.com/home), allowing players to develop their own apps,\nstat trackers, websites, and community integrations.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis documentation is written and maintained by thirdparty developers from the PlanetSide 2\ncommunity and has no affiliation with Daybreak Game Company, Rogue Planet Games, or the\nPlanetSide 2 developer team. If you encounter any errors or have other feedback, please do\nconsider [opening an issue](https://github.com/leonhard-s/ps2-api-docs/issues) or contributing\nto the project directly.\n\n### Warranty\n\nNote that all game data and files made available by Daybreak Game Company are provided \"AS IS\"\nand come with absolutely no warranty. For legal details, please refer to the API's\n[warranty disclaimer](https://census.daybreakgames.com/#warranty) and the Census API [terms of\nservice](https://census.daybreakgames.com#services-api-policy).\n\nFurthermore, the OpenAPI spec provided here is released without any warranty either, though its\nsource code is made available without restriction at the repository link listed in the contact\nsection of this API specification.\n\n### Service IDs\n\nThe Census API uses service IDs to monitor and identify API consumers. These IDs are free and\ncan be requested via [this form](https://census.daybreakgames.com/#devSignup). The process is\nautomatic and you should receive your service ID confirmation email within a few minutes to\nhours.\n\nUsing the API without a service ID is possible and synonymous with using the default service ID of\n`s:example`. However, this service ID is rate-limited to 10 requests per minute and IP address,\nso it is highly recommended to apply for your own service IDs early on.\n\n### Further Reading\n\nThis documentation is intended to be a reference for the API endpoints, parameters, and JSON\nschemas. For a more general introduction to the Census API, examples, and more detailed\ninformation on the `c:join` system, please refer to one of the following resources:\n\n  - [Census API Documentation](https://census.daybreakgames.com/): Official documentation by\n    Daybreak Game Company\n  - [PlanetSide 2 API Tracker](https://github.com/cooltrain7/Planetside-2-API-Tracker): A\n    community-maintained issue tracker and developer resource\n  - [Census API Primer](https://github.com/leonhard-s/auraxium/wiki/Census-API-Primer): A\n    rewritten version of the official documentation with additional details and examples\n  - [PS2 Query GUI](https://eating-coleslaw.github.io/ps2-visual-query/): A GUI web page for\n    querying the Planetside 2 API\n  - [Zone ID Tutorial](https://github.com/cooltrain7/Planetside-2-API-Tracker/wiki/Tutorial:-Zone-IDs):\n    Introduction for working with dynamic zones, such as those spawned for Outfit Wars\n  - [Sanctuary.Census](https://github.com/PS2Sanctuary/Sanctuary.Census): A community endpoint\n    replicating and extending the Census ReST API\n\n### Event Streaming Service\n\nThe PlanetSide 2 API also provides a real-time event streaming service using the WebSocket\nprotocol. This service is not covered by this documentation yet, but you can find more\ninformation at the following links:\n\n  - [PS2 Event Streaming](https://census.daybreakgames.com/#what-is-websocket): Official\n    documentation by Daybreak Game Company\n  - [Nanite Systems ESS](https://github.com/nanite-systems/stream): A replacement endpoint for\n    the ESS designed to provide more reliability\n",

Similarly, comparing the `c:has=<field>` count of a collection with the total can be used to guess whether a field is optional or used.\nClient code should be ready to receive negative values for this endpoint, which is used as the error state for this endpoint, rather than the explicit error payloads sent for the `/get/` query verb.\n",

This is used to control friend-or-foe status for NSO players, or for the opposing factions in Outfit Wars.\nDuring regular gameplay (i.e. outside of Outfit Wars), it is generally safe to treat a team ID as a faction. However, care should be taken during Outfit Wars matches as the team IDs will map to the Alpha and Omega team instead.\n",

All other sections cover specific groups of collections or endpoints that are unique to the PlanetSide 2 namespaces `ps2:v2`, `ps2ps4us:v2`, and `ps2ps4eu:v2`.\n### Query Commands\nThe query commands documented for the generic endpoints are generally universal and can be used with any of the game-specific collections listed in this documentation. However, they are not listed explicitly for brevity.\n### Parameters\nMost endpoints support filtering and sorting by any field in the response schema. As with query parameters, this is not modelled in the documentation to improve readability and focus on the most important parameters.\n### Exceptions and Limitations\nSome collections are special and have restrictions on the query commands and parameters that may be used with them. These are documented in the [\"Special\" PS2 Collections](https://census.daybreakgames.com/#special-collections) section of the Census API documentation.\n"

When looking up a character by name, it is preferable to transform your search query to a lowercase string and compare it against the `character.name.first_lower` field. Case-insensitive queries against the `character.name` field are supported, but may be significantly slower.\n### Character Collection Quirks\nThe records of the `character` collection are distributed across multiple separate databases, each of which handles the same query individually before their results are combined. This means that extra care must be taken when using pagination to step through the data, or when expecting a specific ordering of results: each database will sort its results independently, leading to out-of-order results in the final response received by the client.\n\nWhen ordering is critical, consider using the `c:limitPerDB` query command to fetch the desired number of entries for each database individually and performing a final sort on the client side. This will ensure that the final ordering is consistent, but it will also lead to 20x as much data received, much of which may not be required.\n### Single Character By ID\nWhen retrieving a lot of character data, it may be preferable to use the `single_character_by_id` endpoint instead of individual joins and queries to the relevant endpoints. It is an aggregation of owned items and most player statistics, and is generally much faster to retrieve than the equivalent data from the individual endpoints.\n\nNote that this endpoint has no support for filtering or result field selection, resulting in payloads of several hundred kilobytes in size.\n"

There is a `global/game_server_status` endpoint that can be used to retrieve more detailed status of game servers:\n> **Warning:** This endpoint is not explicitly advertised in the Census API documentation and\n  is not covered by the Census API's terms of service. Use at your own risk.\n\nhttps://census.daybreakgames.com/get/global/game_server_status?game_code=ps2&c:limit=10\n### Static vs. Dynamic Zones\nThe `zone` collection contains the IDs of all persistent zones, such as the main continents and VR training instances.\n\nWhen monitoring player activity via the ESS API, you will encounter additional zone IDs that are not present in the `zone` collection. These are temporary or instanced zones that are created and destroyed dynamically, such as tutorial or Sanctuary, or the various Desolation or Nexus instances during Outfit Wars.\n\nFor details on interpreting dynamic zone IDs, refer to the [Zone ID Tutorial](https://github.com/cooltrain7/Planetside-2-API-Tracker/wiki/Tutorial:-Zone-IDs) on GitHub.\n"
