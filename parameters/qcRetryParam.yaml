description: By default, the API will retry any queries once before failing. By setting
  this value to `false`, you can fail earlier, which can be useful if you have your
  own retry mechanisms or logging configuration.
examples:
  noRetry:
    summary: Retry disabled
    value: 'false'
  notSet:
    summary: Unset
    value: ''
in: query
name: c:retry
schema:
  enum:
  - 'true'
  - 'false'
  - '0'
  - '1'
