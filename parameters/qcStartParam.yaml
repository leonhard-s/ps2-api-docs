description: Skips the first N results from the result list. Together with `c:limit`,
  can be used for pagination. Note that sorting may be required to get consistent
  orderings. Due to the multiple databases used, this behaves unusually for the `ps2/character`
  collection.
examples:
  five:
    summary: Skip first 10 Results
    value: 10
  notSet:
    summary: Unset
    value: 0
in: query
name: c:start
schema:
  minimum: 0
  type: integer
