  Endpoint for playable and non-playable factions.

  In addition to the main empires VS, NC, and TR, this also lists NS Operatives as the 4th
  faction. Note that a faction ID of zero does not denote an empty value. Instead, it
  represents a special "None" faction, which is used for common pool equipment, and also
  serves as a sentinel value for disabled facilities in the context of facility ownership.

  When working with the Event Streaming Service (ESS), you will encounter a `team_id` field
  in certain payloads. This is used to control friend-or-foe status for NSO players, or for
  the opposing factions in Outfit Wars.

  During regular gameplay (i.e. outside of Outfit Wars), it is generally safe to treat a team
  ID as a faction. However, care should be taken during Outfit Wars matches as the team IDs
  will map to the Alpha and Omega team instead.
