  Query the leaderboard for a character. Note that only the top 10'000 players for a given
  statistic are tracked in the leaderboard; many characters will not have an entry in this
  collection.


  The `limit` key inserted into the response indicates the number of requested entries when
  passing multiple character IDs. Comparison with `returned` may be used to determine whether
  any characters were skipped due to not being in the leaderboard.
