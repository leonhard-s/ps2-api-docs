  Weapon statistics endpoint containing generic values such as playtime or score while
  wielding. The most common use is calculating the accuracy of a player with a given weapon
  by dividing `weapon_hit_count` by `weapon_fire_count`.

  - `stat_name` lists the name of the stat
  - `item_id` identifies the item for the weapon. Note that this value can be zero, in that
    case it serves as a catch-all for all weapons for the given `vehicle_id`.
  - `vehicle_id` the vehicle on which the weapon is available.
