  Faction-specific statistics endpoint. Useful for determining faction bias or kill spread.

  - `stat_name` lists the name of the stat
  - `profile` represents the class, with a value of 0 denoting a character-wide value

  All `value_*` fields are provided per-faction. Note that the value for the own faction is
  often blanked: `value_nc` of the stat `kills` cannot be used to enumerate an NC character's
  team kills, for example.
