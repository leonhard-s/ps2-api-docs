description: >
  Global leaderboard for a given server. This only includes the top 10'000 players for a
  given category and is not directly searchable. See `characters_leaderboard` to look up a
  character's ranking.


  `c:start` and `c:limit` are supported and allow for pagination. `c:join` and `c:tree` are
  also permitted. Any other query commands will be silently ignored.


  Unlike most other tables, this one defaults to a `c:limit` value of 10 and is always sorted
  in ascending order of leaderboard rank.
