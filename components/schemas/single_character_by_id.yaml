  Endpoint for retrieving bulk character stats.

  This endpoint's payload is a superset of `character` and additionally includes data from
  related `characters_*` collections:

  - `characters_currency`
  - `characters_stat_history`
  - `characters_stat`
  - `characters_stat_by_faction`
  - `characters_weapon_stat`
  - `characters_weapon_stat_by_faction`
  - `characters_items`

  This endpoint is generally faster than querying these collections individually, but it
  comes with significant bandwidth costs. Note that this endpoint does not support most query
  commands, and that `c:show` and `c:hide` cannot be used to reduce the amount of data
  returned.
