  Items in PlanetSide 2 represent many different things beyond weapons, such as implant
  packs, cosmetics, or name change tokens. They are also used as internal helpers when
  pulling outfit resources, spawning vehicles, or interacting with certain terminals.


  This collection lists the different item types, though many of these are never encountered
  on the API.
