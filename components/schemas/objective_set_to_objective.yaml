  Maps objective sets to objective groups.


  This collection is peculiar as neither of the types it connects are available on the API.
  It is however essential for connecting the `directive` collection to `objective` and
  `objective_type`.


  Note that when joining to these queries, the `^on:` and `^to:` fields must be used to
  specify the relationship.
