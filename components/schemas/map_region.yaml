  A region on the in-game map.


  Map regions are largely identical to their corresponding regions, but use the internal
  `facility_name` instead of a localized string. A `map_region_id` and `region_id` are
  interchangeable.


  Additionally, this collection allows connecting facilities to map region IDs.


  Note that the continuous outfit resource gain is listed in "ticks", not minutes. Ticks are
  5 minutes as of writing, meaning that a Tech Plant will list a tick reward of 8 Synthium,
  corresponding to the 1.6 Synthium per minute advertised in-game.
