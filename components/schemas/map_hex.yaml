  Endpoint for retrieving map hex coordinates.

  This data can be used to reconstruct the in-game facility outlines from API data.


  The X and Y coordinates listed in the entries to this collection are not Cartesian and do
  not match up with the `location_<n>` fields of `map_region`. Instead, they are describing
  locations in a non-orthogonal hexagonal grid, which must be converted by the user.


  This website has a great write-up on hexagonal coordinate systems:
  <https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/>.

  The coordinate system used by PlanetSide 2 matches the "Axial coordinates" described in the
  article, except that the first coordinate X faces east, and the second coordinate Y faces
  up and to the right at a 60° angle.
