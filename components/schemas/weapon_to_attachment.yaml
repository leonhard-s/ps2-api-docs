type: object
description: >
  Maps weapons to the attachments available to them. This table is largely synonymous with
  `item_attachment`, but contains additional entries that may not resolve to a valid item.


  For this reason, it is recommended to base any attachment queries on the
  `item_attachment` endpoint instead.
