  Bundles available for purchase in the in-game store (Depot). This collection represents
  actual bundles. For pseudo-bundles used to purchase individual weapon attachments or
  cosmetics, see the `marketing_bundle_with_1_item` collection instead.


  Note that there is no guaranteed way of determining whether a given bundle is currently
  available for purchase. This collection contains many entries for defunct items and
  bundles, such as the single-use camos from the early days of the game.


  This collection is automatically maintained and generally accurate with regards to
  certification prices, the daybreak/station cash values are generally less reliable.
