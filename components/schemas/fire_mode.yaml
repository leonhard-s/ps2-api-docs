  **Note:** This table has been largely superceded by `fire_mode_2`, which contains
  additional and more accurate information about firing mechanics.


  This endpoint shows detailed information about a given fire mode for a weapon, including
  damage ranges, muzzle velocity, and reload time.


  For details on the cone-of-fire mechanics, resolve the `player_state_group_id` field.
