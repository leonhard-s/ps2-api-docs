        The head model selected by the player. This includes the two genders as well as the four head types, giving a total of eight variants.

        For human player models, head IDs `1` through `4` are the male variants, `5` through `8` are the female head shapes.

        There are ~160 characters with a head ID of `0` (bad data?), and NSO characters appear to be limited to head IDs `1` through `4`.
