    Armour specification for an entity.

    Armour is a vehicle-specific property tha tmodifies incoming damage depending on the angle of attack. Note that this mechanic uses the relative position of the attacker to the impacted vehicle, not the actual impact location of the projectile.

    A vehicle generally has multiple armour info entries associated with different armour facing directions.

    Note that these armour percentages may be negative, in which case the damage dealt is increased beyond the base damage of the weapon.

        Damage reduction in percent. A value of `10.0` denotes a damage reduction of 10 percent. Negative armour values will increase damage taken:

        `actual_damage = (1 - (armor_percent / 100)) * base_damage`
