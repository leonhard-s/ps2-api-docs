    Resources are entity-specific states used by other mechanics.

    You can think of them as attributes attached to a character or vehicle that is then modified by other game mechanics.

    This includes active class abilities like the Combat Medic's Regeneration Device or the Heavy Assault's shield, physical resources like Cortium carried by A.N.T.s or Collossi, but are also used as a reservoir for other game mechanics like Esamir's Electrical Storm vehicle de-buff.
