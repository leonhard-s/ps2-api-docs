  summary: Character Weapon Stats By Faction
  description: |
    Weapon-specific character stats for a given character. Unlike `characters_weapon_stat`, this enumerates faction-specific data like deaths, kills and damage dealt.

    `stat_name` can be one of the following statistics: `weapon_damage_given`, `weapon_damage_taken_by`, `weapon_headshots`, `weapon_killed_by`, `weapon_kills`, and `weapon_vehicle_kills`

    Note that friendly fire is not tracked for these tables.
