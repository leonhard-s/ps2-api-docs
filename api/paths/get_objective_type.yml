  summary: Objective Types
  description: |
    A type of objective.

    Objective types act like base classes for their respective objectives, and mostly serve to specify the types of any generic parameters (`param*`).

    For the objective type, these parameters are set to brief descriptions of what the parameter is used for in objectives of that type.
