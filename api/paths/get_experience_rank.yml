  summary: Experience Ranks
  description: |
    An experience rank a player may attain.

    This entry defines the battle rank names for each faction. Note that unlike most other collections, the `experience_id` field is **not** unique. This is due to the A.S.P. prestige system reusing the same IDs while specifying new names. Use the `character.prestige_level` value to differentiate between IDs (all A.S.P. ranks are called "A.S.P. Operative" in the English locale).
