  summary: Resource Types
  description: |
    Resources are entity-specific states used by other mechanics.

    You can think of them as attributes attached to a character or vehicle that are then modified by other game mechanics.

    This includes active class abilities like the Combat Medic's Nano Regen Device or the Heavy Assault's over-shield, physical resources like Cortium carried by A.N.T.s or Collossi, but are also used as a reservoir for external mechanics like Esamir's Electrical Storm vehicle de-buff.
