  summary: Character Stat History
  description: |
    Historical character statistics endpoint.

    In addition to the daily, weekly, and monthly lists (stored in the `day`, `week`, and `month` sub-key respectively), this endpoint lists the `all_time`, and `one_life_max` values for these stats as well. 
    Note that the `battle_rank` value is reset by the A.S.P. prestige system and does not reflect the actual cumulative battle rank of the player.

    The stat names available are: `battle_rank`, `certs`, `deaths`, `facility_capture`, `facility_defend`, `kills`, `medals`, `ribbons`, `score`, and `time`.
