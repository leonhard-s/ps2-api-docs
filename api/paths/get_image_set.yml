  summary: Image Set
  description: |
    A collection of identical images in multiple resolutions.

    Some image assets, like class or vehicle icons, come in multiple sizes (32 px, 64 px, 128 px, etc.). This endpoint lists those variations and makes them searchable.

    Note that this collection is not a reliable indicator of whether a given image exists on the file CDN.
