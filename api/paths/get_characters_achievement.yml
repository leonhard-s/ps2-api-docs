  summary: Character Achievement Progress
  description: |
    A mapping of achievement progress to characters.

    Note that repeatable `achievement`s (like ribbons) are tracked differently from one-off ones (like weapon medals).

    For repeatable achievements, the `finish` field will never be set. Instead, the `start` field will be set to the last time the achievement was completed once `completion_count` is greater than 1.
