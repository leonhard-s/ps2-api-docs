  summary: Item Type
  description: |
    An internal differentiation based on item functionality.

    For in-game item types like "Vehicle Weapon" or "Carbine", see the `item_category` collection instead.

    This differentiates items into the type of action they produce. This includes normal differentiations like "Consumable", or "Weapon", but also internal mechanics like "CreateVehicle" or "GiveCurrency".
