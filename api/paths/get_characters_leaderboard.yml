  summary: Character Leaderboard
  description: |
    Query the position of a character in the server leaderboard.

    Note that only the top 10'000 characters are stored in the leaderboard, this may not produce a result for all characters.

    The stat to look up is specified using the `name` argument. Possible values include `Kills`, `Score`, `Time`, `Deaths`.
    The period to track is specified using the `period` argument. Possible values are `Forever`, `Weekly`, `Daily`, `OneLife`.

    The `OneLife` period is only reset when a character dies without being revived or redeploying and can be an unexpectedly high value.
