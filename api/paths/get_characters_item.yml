  summary: Character Items
  description: |
    Lists a character's unlocked items.

    This includes weapons and attachments unlocked via certification points, as well as cosmetics unlocked via Daybreak Cash. If the `account_level` flag is set for a given entry, it was unlocked through DBC or has been unlocked as part of a giveaway or redeemable code.

    Note that the size of this payload varies wildly with the age of a character. High level characters with many unlocks will have thousands of entries, making this a very expensive table.
