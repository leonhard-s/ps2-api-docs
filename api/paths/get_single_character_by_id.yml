    Highly optimized endpoint for bulk character data.

    Note that this endpoint is very fast compared to the collections it references, but also has extremely large payloads for older characters (multiple MBs per character). Be wary of bandwidth usage when working with this query as it does not support query commands to filter the response keys.
