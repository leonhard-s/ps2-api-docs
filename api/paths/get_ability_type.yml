  summary: Ability Types
  description: |
    Ability types define the core mechanics behind abilities of that type and can be through of like a base class for the corresponding abilities.

    In the API, they mostly serve to specify the purpose of generic parameters like `param1`. Where an `ability` will specify the actual value for this property, the `ability_type` instead returns a string documenting the purpose of that field.

    Unfortunately, this documentation is not always present, which can make reverse-engineering of ability mechanics quite difficult. If you have any details or would like to get involved, please do get in touch via the project repository.
