  summary: Character vs. Character Events
  description: |
    This endpoint lists character-specific events specific to other characters.

    In particular, it lists the number of kills and deaths for each character by character, which can be used to calculate matchup-specific KDRs.

    The only values available for the `table_type` field are `"KILL"` and `"DEATH"`.
