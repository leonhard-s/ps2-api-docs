  summary: Fire Mode Type
  description: |
    Specifies the action taken when a weapon is fired.

    The default fire mode type, `Projectile`, is used for hip-fired or otherwise not ADS-able weapons. `IronSight` is used when aiming down sights (ADS).

    `Melee` is used for both quick knifing and equipped knives. `Thrown` is responsible for grenades and mines, and `Trigger Item Ability` is a hook used to place turrets and other constructable items.
