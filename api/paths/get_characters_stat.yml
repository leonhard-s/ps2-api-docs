  summary: Character Statistics
  description: |
    General character statistics.

    This endpoint provides two sets of statistics: one for the entire `character` (provided with `profile_id` set to 0), and a different set for specific profiles.

    The following statistics are profile-independent: `achievement_count`, `assist_count`, `facility_defended_count`, `medal_count`, `skill_points`, `weapon_deaths`, `weapon_fire_count`, `weapon_hit_count`, `weapon_play_time`, and `weapon_score`.

    Profile-specific statistics are separate: `deaths`, `fire_count`, `hit_count`, `play_time`, and `score`.
