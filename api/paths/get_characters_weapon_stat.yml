  summary: Character Weapon Stats
  description: |
    Generic weapon statistics for a given character. For faction-specific stats like damage dealt or kills, refer to the `characters_weapon_stat_by_faction` instead.

    This collection lists weapon-specific stats that are not faction-specific. This includes the following `stat_name` values: `weapon_deaths`, `weapon_fire_count`, `weapon_hit_count`, `weapon_play_time`, and `weapon_score`.
