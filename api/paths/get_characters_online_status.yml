  summary: Character Online Status
  description: |
    Return the online status of a given character.

    The online status of offline characters will be `0`. Online characters will report the `world` ID of the server they are online `OneLife`.

    This quirk can be used to filter characters by online status by performing an inner join from this collection to the `world`. The join will fail for offline characters, leaving only payloads for online characters in the response.
