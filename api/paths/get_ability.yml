  summary: Abilities
  description: |
    An ability triggered by a character or vehicle.

    See the corresponding `ability_type` for information on generic parameters.

    The in-game mechanics these abilities correspond to are currently undocumented due to the lack of links between abilities and other types in the API. More information needed & much appreciated.
