  summary: Character Friends List
  description: |
    Retrieve the friends list for a given character.

    In addition to the `character` IDs, the returned object also lists the `last_login_time` timestamp and online status of the character. Note that unlike the `characters_online_status` endpoint, the `online` flag in this list only switches between 0 and 1 and does not represent the world ID they are logged into.

    The `name` property is always NULL.
