  summary: Fire Mode 2
  description: |
    A fire mode of a weapon.

    *This table supersedes the original `fire_mode` by providing more detailed and accurate information.*

    An API fire mode defines the bulk of a weapon's stats, such as reload times, default accuracy and cone-of-fire statistics. Do not confuse this with in-game fire modes (automatic, triple burst, etc.) as those are represented by the `fire_group` collection instead.

    Most infantry weapons have two fire modes, one for being hip-fired and another used when aiming down sights. Fore more information on fire mode types, refer to the `fire_mode_type` collection.

    Keep in mind that most accuracy-related stats can be overwritten by the current `player_state`, i.e. whether the character is jumping, crouching, etc.
    Refer to the `player_state_group` linked by the fire mode for the state-dependent overrides for this fire mode.
