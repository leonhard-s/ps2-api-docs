    ## Introduction

    The Daybreak Game Company Census API provides access to game and character data for the MMOFPS
    [PlanetSide 2](https://www.planetside2.com/home), allowing players to develop their own apps,
    stat trackers, websites, and community integrations.

    ### Disclaimer

    This documentation is written and maintained by thirdparty developers from the PlanetSide 2
    community and has no affiliation with Daybreak Game Company, Rogue Planet Games, or the
    PlanetSide 2 developer team. If you encounter any errors or have other feedback, please do
    consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/leonhard-s/ps2-api-docs/issues) or contributing
    to the project directly.

    ### Warranty

    Note that all game data and files made available by Daybreak Game Company are provided "AS IS"
    and come with absolutely no warranty. For legal details, please refer to the API's
    [warranty disclaimer](https://census.daybreakgames.com/#warranty) and the Census API [terms of
    service](https://census.daybreakgames.com#services-api-policy).

    Furthermore, the OpenAPI spec provided here is released without any warranty either, though its
    source code is made available without restriction at the repository link listed in the contact
    section of this API specification.

    ### Service IDs

    The Census API uses service IDs to monitor and identify API consumers. These IDs are free and
    can be requested via [this form](https://census.daybreakgames.com/#devSignup). The process is
    automatic and you should receive your service ID confirmation email within a few minutes to
    hours.

    Using the API without a service ID is possible and synonymous with using the default service ID of
    `s:example`. However, this service ID is rate-limited to 10 requests per minute and IP address,
    so it is highly recommended to apply for your own service IDs early on.

    ### Further Reading

    This documentation is intended to be a reference for the API endpoints, parameters, and JSON
    schemas. For a more general introduction to the Census API, examples, and more detailed

    ### Event Streaming Service

    The PlanetSide 2 API also provides a real-time event streaming service using the WebSocket
    protocol. This service is not covered by this documentation yet, but you can find more
    information at the following links:

        Lists the number of entries in the given collection.

        This endpoint can be used to determine an appropriate pagination strategy based on the size
        of the result list, but it is especially useful for API introspection as it still supports
        query strings, including search modifiers and certain query commands.

        For example, the `weapon` collection may be queried with `c:has=heat_capacity` to get the
        number of heat-based weapons. Similarly, comparing the `c:has=<field>` count of a
        collection with the total can be used to guess whether a field is optional or used.

        Client code should be ready to receive negative values for this endpoint, which is used as
        the error state for this endpoint, rather than the explicit error payloads sent for the
        `/get/` query verb.

        In addition to the name of the collection, this endpoint may also list the number of
        entries in the associated table via the `count` field. Note that the `hidden` field is of
        no practical use to API consumers as it is always `false`.

        The keys in the `resolve_list` field are permittable values for the `c:resolve=<field>`
        query command. Note that resolve lists precede the `c:join=<...>` subquery system and has
        been largely superceded by it. For this reason, the resolved fields are not included in any
        example payload or other parts of this documentation.

        Curious fact: this is one of the few endpoints in the PlanetSide 2 API that returns native
        JSON types (`boolean`, `number`, etc.) in its response, without wrapping them in a string.

      This section covers basic Census API usage and parameters.

      The parameters and response schemas documented here are applicable to all Daybreak Games
      titles supported by the Census API. All other sections cover specific groups of collections
      or endpoints that are unique to the PlanetSide 2 namespaces `ps2:v2`, `ps2ps4us:v2`, and
      `ps2ps4eu:v2`.

      The query commands documented for the generic endpoints are generally universal and can be
      used with any of the game-specific collections listed in this documentation. However, they
      are not listed explicitly for brevity.

      ### Parameters

      Most endpoints support filtering and sorting by any field in the response schema. As with
      query parameters, this is not modelled in the documentation to improve readability and focus
      on the most important parameters.

      ### Exceptions and Limitations

      Some collections are special and have restrictions on the query commands and parameters that
      may be used with them. These are documented in the ["Special" PS2
      Collections](https://census.daybreakgames.com/#special-collections) section of the Census API
      documentation.
  - name: Character Information
    description: >
      This section covers player names, directives, and other character-specific collections.

      ### Name Lookups

      Names in PlanetSide 2 are case-insensitive. When looking up a character by name, it is
      preferable to transform your search query to a lowercase string and compare it against the
      `character.name.first_lower` field. Case-insensitive queries against the `character.name`
      field are supported, but may be significantly slower.

      ### Character Collection Quirks

      The records of the `character` collection are distributed across multiple separate databases,
      each of which handles the same query individually before their results are combined. This
      means that extra care must be taken when using pagination to step through the data, or when
      expecting a specific ordering of results: each database will sort its results independently,
      leading to out-of-order results in the final response received by the client.


      When ordering is critical, consider using the `c:limitPerDB` query command to fetch the
      desired number of entries for each database individually and performing a final sort on the
      client side. This will ensure that the final ordering is consistent, but it will also lead
      to 20x as much data received, much of which may not be required.

      ### Single Character By ID

      When retrieving a lot of character data, it may be preferable to use the
      `single_character_by_id` endpoint instead of individual joins and queries to the relevant
      endpoints. It is an aggregation of owned items and most player statistics, and is generally
      much faster to retrieve than the equivalent data from the individual endpoints.


      Note that this endpoint has no support for filtering or result field selection, resulting in
      payloads of several hundred kilobytes in size.
  - name: Fundamentals
    description: >
      Core collections related to the PlanetSide 2 game world.

      ### Worlds

      A "world" in the PlanetSide 2 API refers to a game server. The `world` collection contains
      the IDs and names of the game servers.


      Basic server status (locked vs. online) is available as part of the `world` collection. There
      is a `global/game_server_status` endpoint that can be used to retrieve more detailed status
      of game servers:

      > **Warning:** This endpoint is not explicitly advertised in the Census API documentation and
        is not covered by the Census API's terms of service. Use at your own risk.

      https://census.daybreakgames.com/get/global/game_server_status?game_code=ps2&c:limit=10

      ### Static vs. Dynamic Zones

      The `zone` collection contains the IDs of all persistent zones, such as the main continents
      and VR training instances.


      When monitoring player activity via the ESS API, you will encounter additional zone IDs that
      are not present in the `zone` collection. These are temporary or instanced zones that are
      created and destroyed dynamically, such as tutorial or Sanctuary, or the various Desolation
      or Nexus instances during Outfit Wars.


      For details on interpreting dynamic zone IDs, refer to the [Zone ID
      Tutorial](https://github.com/cooltrain7/Planetside-2-API-Tracker/wiki/Tutorial:-Zone-IDs) on
      GitHub.
  - name: Outfits
    description: >
      Collections related to PlanetSide 2 outfits and outfit membership.

      ### Outfit Lookup

      As with the `character` collection, outfit names and tags are case-insensitive. When looking
      up an outfit by name or tag, it is preferable to transform your search query to a lowercase
      string and compare it against the `outfit.name_lower` or `outfit.alias_lower` fields.
      Case-insensitive queries against the `outfit.name` or `outfit.alias` fields are possible, but
      may be significantly slower.

      ### Outfit Resources

      The outfit resources introduced in the Escalation update are not available via the Census
      API.

      However, some information about outfit resource use can be obtained through the
      `GuildBankWithdrawal` context of the `ItemAdded` event. For additional information, please
      refer to the [Outfit Assets](https://github.com/cooltrain7/Planetside-2-API-Tracker/wiki/Stream:Outfit-Assets)
      section of the [PS2 API Tracker Wiki](https://github.com/cooltrain7/Planetside-2-API-Tracker/wiki).
  - name: Statistics
    description: >
      Player statistics such as kills, deaths, and score.

      Refer to the `stat_name` parameter of the individual endpoints for a list of supported
      statistics. Note that some `stat_name` values are only available in combination with certain
      profiles.

      > **Note:** There is no accuracy statistic in any of these collections, it must be calculated
      from the `fire_count / hit_count` ratio. Likewise, headshot ratio must be calculated from
      `weapon_headshots / weapon_kills`. Also consider sanitizing the kills by not considering
      vehicles for the headshot ratio: `weapon_headshots / (weapon_kills - weapon_vehicle_kills)`.

      ### Collection Overview

      The following overview provides a brief description of the different endpoints and what kinds
      of statistics they contain:

      - `characters_stat`: Play time, total deaths, medals, and score
      - `characters_weapon_stat`: Damage given and taken, kills and deaths per faction
      - `character_stat_history`: Select statistics over time, essentially those found in the
        in-game stat history tab
      - `characters_weapon_stat`: Per-weapon accuracy, score, and playtime
      - `characters_weapon_stat_by_faction`: Per-weapon kills, deaths, and headshots

      > **Note:** Consider using the `single_character_by_id` endpoint when working with individual
      players' statistics. It contains most of the statistics available in the individual endpoints
      and is generally much faster to retrieve.
  - name: Leaderboards
    description: >
      Leaderboard entries for the top 10'000 players in each leaderboard category.


      The `leaderboard` endpoint covers the top 10'000 players, while the `characters_leaderboard`
      endpoint allows retrieving the position of a specific character within a leaderboard.


      Note that the `characters_leaderboard` endpoint will not return a result if the character is
      not in the top 10'000 for the given leaderboard category. In this case, the endpoint will
      return an empty result set.
  - name: Items & Bundles
    description: >
      Collections related to item enumeration and availability, as well as the in-game depot.


      This section covers the item side of weapons and attachments: their names, descriptions,
      icons, and type. Weapon information, attachment modifiers, and firing mechanics are covered
      separately.

      ### Depot Bundles

      The `marketing_bundle` and `marketing_bundle_with_1_item` collections contain information
      about all bundles that have been available in the depot, including ones that are currently
      unavailable, such as seasonal bundles.


      There is no endpoint for retrieving current bundle availability, sales, or discounts.
  - name: Weapons & Firing Mechanics
    description: >
      Weapon and firing mechanics data, including fire modes, projectiles, and ammo types.

      > **Note:** Be wary of the `weapon_datasheet` collection as it has a tendency to contain
        outdated or incorrect information. It is therefore considered deprecated by this
        documentation, and suggestions for alternatives for the information it provides are
        provided as part of its schema documentation.

      This documentation only provides an overview of the available data and basic information on
      how to interpret it. If you are looking for a comprehensive write-up on weapon mechanics and
      hidden stats, please refer to the following resources instead:

  - name: Vehicles
    description: >
      Collections related to vehicles, attachments, and vehicle certifications.
  - name: Damage Calculation
    description: >
      Armor values and resistances used for damage calculation.
  - name: Effects & Abilities
    description: >
      Collections related to abilities, passive effects, and character resources.

      ### Abilities

      Abilities are cast by players or deployable entities such as shield emitters. Many abilities
      consume resources while they are active, such as the Heavy Assault's overshield energy or
      the Infiltrators "Cloaker Juice".

      ### Effects vs. Zone Effects

      The `effect` collection primarily covers one-off effects tied to weapon fire modes, such as
      direct damage, splash damage, and EMP effects.


      The `zone_effect` collection handles persistent effects, such as the passive (de)buffs
      applied by weapon attachments and implants.
  - name: Skills, Certifications, and A.S.P.
    description: >
      Collections related to certification trees and A.S.P. skills.

      Note that A.S.P. tokens are treated as a currency and have been injected into the response
      for the `characters_currency` collection, next to Nanites.
